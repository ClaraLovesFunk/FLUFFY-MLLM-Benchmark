        "output_multiple choice (sqa)": "the answer is pair 2 because: magnets can pull or push on each other without touching\nwhen magnets attract, they pull together when magnets repel, they push apart\nthe strength of a force is called its magnitude the greater the magnitude of an attract or repel force, the more strength in the force\nimagine a magnetic field coming from a magnet the magnetic field makes a point on the magnet look have a positive charge because the magnetic field comes from the magnet, a neighborhood has a negative charge the area of the magnet's magnetic field small, so, it has a small magnitude of its magnetic force on another magnet"
