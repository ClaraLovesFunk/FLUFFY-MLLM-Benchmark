        "output_multiple choice (sqa)": "The answer is (Do steel nuts rust in lesser days when submersed in a larger volume of fluid compared to small volume). BECAUSE: Scientists can use tools such as knives and scissors to answer questions about the past. In order to use a knife or a scissor, you must use it to cut something. The object that things are cut in the past are called evidence.\nHow old is this object? It is very old, as it has been around a long time. It is also called an artifact.\nAn artifact is different from a living organism. An artifact is made of stone, metal, or other material that has been cut and changed. Scientists look at the type of metal and how the object is cut. This helps them decide what kinds of animals or plants these animals or tools might have been used by."

        "output_multiple choice (sqa)": "The answer is the element of the public opinion. BECAUSE: Magnets can engage with each other without touching. When magnets engage on a plane, they can push and pull each other away. These interactions are called magnetic forces.\nThe direction of a force is called the direction or orientation. The two magnetic forces on each magnet are called the magnetic poles.\nEach magnetic pole on a magnet is either positive or negative.\nScientists can describe each magnetic pole as either north or south.\nHere are some common magnets:\nThe north pole is usually on the left side of an arrow.\nIt is less magnetic than the south pole. The south pole is generally on the right side of the arrow and is more magnetic than both the north and negative poles.

Some fossils are formed from body parts like bones or shells.\nThe age of the organism from its fossils can be used to learn about their age relative to the present. The different types of fossils show different animals or organisms that have been used for comparison purposes.\nThere are several types of fossil organisms, such as organisms from the ocean, insects, and plants. Each type of fossil shows that they are different ages, more or less common over time, and, sometimes, differences in the type of environment they lived in."

        "output_multiple choice (sqa)": "The answer is Pair 2. BECAUSE: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching.\nWhen magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.\nThe strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of an attract or repel force, the more strength in the force.\nImagine a magnetic field coming from a magnet. The magnetic field makes a point on the magnet look have a positive charge. Because the magnetic field comes from the magnet, a neighborhood has a negative charge. The area of the magnet's magnetic field small, so, it has a small magnitude of its magnetic force on another magnet."

        "output_multiple choice (sqa)": "The answer is kelp. BECAUSE: A food web is every organism in an ecosystem, both living and nonliving, and their relationships or connections.\nThe organisms in a food web often interact in both food and space. The term food web refers to a network or chain of organisms in an ocean ecosystem. The environment (or ecosystem) can affect the position of the organism in the food web. Predation plays a key role in food web relationships among organisms.\nFirst, organisms can create their own food through photosynthesis. This type of food production turns light, carbon dioxide, and water into food. This food is then consumed by other organisms in the same area.\nThen, other organisms eat other organisms. For example, a predator eats another predator, and a consumer eats a predator. Scientists define organisms in food webs based on the types of food they eat. Predators and consumers often are called \"top predators\" or \"top consumers.\" Organisms that are eaten by top predators or consumers are considered \"middle organisms.\" Beneath the ocean's surface, many organisms live in the light. These organisms are called plankton. Plankton are small organisms, such as plankton, that are mostly less than 10 centimeters (4 inches) long. They play important roles in the ocean. For instance, plankton help break up ocean water and release oxygen."

BECAUSE: A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.\nThe size of a planet is a very important piece of information about planet size because planets are compared to each other based on their volume, or size.\n The volume of a volume is a certain amount of space in units. Volume is a lot like length or distance. If you have a volume and a unit of measurement, you can use a formula to find the other values.\nComparing planets is a common science topic, and the amount of material in a planet, called its mass, is a key value for comparison. Mass is measured in units such as kilograms, or in units specific to certain elements."

Scientists call these small pieces of metal atoms.\nAtoms can be used to make tools that can cut other objects. So, you can use a metal's atoms to find out how sharp a knife is.\nWhen a metal is rusty, its atoms have lost some of their outer layer of atoms. This layer is called a rusty layer. Rusty atoms can be very small, and they are not all stuck on the metal. Many rusty atoms are in small, fine pieces. These pieces can be called rust."

        "output_multiple choice (sqa)": "The answer is Pair 2. BECAUSE: A force is a push or a pull that one object has on another. Each type of force - push or pull - can make an object move differently compared to the other.\nThe direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing, and the object moves toward the person or thing doing the pushing.\nIf two objects are next to each other, one object can have a push on the other with the same strength as the other object having a pull on it.\nThese two types of forces - push and pull, or sometimes just called positive and negative forces - are called opposite forces.\nMagnetic forces are one example of these types of objects."
