It's important to remember that rejection is a normal part of life, and it doesn't define your worth as a person. It's also essential to respect the other person's decision and boundaries. If you're feeling down, consider reaching out to friends or family members for support, or engaging in self-care activities that help you feel better. Remember that there are plenty of other people out there who may be a good match for friendship, and don't give up on finding someone who shares your interests and values."
