Implementation Instructions/Example:
https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA

To run the model you'll need to install its dependencies. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venvs/llava15
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

FYI: 
model was not fully implemented an run.

Temperature: 
0.001 (because 0 does not work)
